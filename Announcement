Dear workshop participants,

Your instructors would like to welcome you to this exciting 3-day workshop on Data Visualization with Python and share some important logistics and information about the material we will cover:
1 -  We have created a website where we will be posting all the material we will cover during the workshop. You will also be able to access the website after the workshop in case you want to revisit the content in the future. The website can be found here: ***
2 – There is no preparation required on your behalf ahead of the workshop. We will start by covering the fundamentals that you need to get started using Python for visualizations. We will use Google notebooks for the different parts of the workshop and walk you through each step: data preparation, basic charts, and advanced charts. 
3 – Part of the workshop includes some collaborative exercises. We will use Zoom breakout rooms to allow you to tackle these problems with some of your fellow participants, before we all reconvene to go over them together.

We hope you are as excited as we are for this workshop!

Your instructors,
Anna Haensch and Georgios Georgalis
